They are thought to be substituted for the trade due to their melodious song, which resembles other famous bulbul species like the Straw-headed Bulbul. The most commonly sold species often experience the worst welfare along the trade chain, as they are found and trapped in large numbers, so they are cheap. Cheap birds often experience poor welfare since the bird is not always worth more alive.",

            "Often sold in large numbers, this species remains unprotected (Tens of thousands of birds being sold illegally in Javan bird markets). These species are often confiscated because they are transported without permits under quarantine law rather than because they are characterized as protected species under conservation law."

I observed this species (I couldnâ€™t tell which was which) in certain markets. Traders were either quick to say it was not the Javan Green Magpie or the bird was out of sight, at the back of shops or shown on the lowest level of stacked cages, closest to the floor, away from eye level.",
            "It was only recognised as a separate species from its rare Javan counterpart in 2013. By then, the numbers of the Javan Green Magpie had already dropped precipitously. A conservation breeding program was rapidly established to ensure there were at least populations in captivity from which to draw."

During my fieldwork in West Kalimantan, I was offered one for 1DR 150 million, though the trader later joked that this was a joke and that the bird was a competition winner so was too valuable to sell. This species is thought to have been desired by royalty and other nobility in the Javanese kingdoms, with the earliest records dating back to the early 1400s. This bird symbolises all Javanese birdkeeping, though it remains unprotected under Indonesian protection laws and is critically endangered. In Jogja, there are older conventions from the royal family. They used to hang birds and expensive birds outside the palace as a symbol of social status. Some of these species were always popular and costly, who set them as desirable."

Now, it lives in a semi-wild context in Bali Barat National Park, where a dedicated team of rangers monitors the population and supplies feeding stations. Since the market was also flooded with cheaper captive-bred options, availability increased, and the overall price and rarity of the wild populations decreased. This was made possible through community-level connections and associations with bird breeding associations across Indonesia."

It is presumed extinction in the wild, so captive breeding efforts are currently limited to reintroducing and crossbreeding with other species in the genus. It differs from the nominate Asian Pied Starling largely due to its pink beak. For most of the volume of the two species, the Javan pied starling is an interesting case study since it does not yet enjoy species-level status despite widespread acceptance of this status by bird keepers and ornithologists alike."
